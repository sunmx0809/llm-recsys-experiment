    "tier": 1,
    "rationale": "Cropped cognac/brown suede jacket with oversized relaxed fit, statement toggle hardware closures, and textured material. Aligns strongly across silhouette (cropped, relaxed), color (warm cognac), material (suede with texture), hardware details, and retro sensibility. Price at $700 fits the willingness to pay more for a distinctive piece."

    "tier": 3,
    "rationale": "Hip-length utility jacket in olive/khaki with a belted waist creating a more fitted silhouette. The warm earth tone and pocket detailing are mildly positive, but the cinched waist contradicts the relaxed/oversized fit preference and the jacket lacks textural interest or distinctive detailing."

    "name": "HERITAGE SUEDE JACKET",
    "tier": 2,
    "rationale": "Suede jacket in warm camel/cognac with snap hardware and oversized relaxed fit. The color, material, snap closures, and pocket detailing align well, but the image shows a mid-length piece that may fall near or slightly below hip level, and the lighter camel shade is less strongly preferred than darker browns."

    "tier": 4,

The dark olive earth tone, zip closure, oversized relaxed fit, visual interest through the floral print, and hip length align well. However, quilted/puffer is an anti-preference, though the floral pattern and snap pockets add artisanal personality that partially offsets this, and the $180 price is within the core range."

    "tier": 3,
    "rationale": "Short car coat in off-white/cream with button closure and reversible construction. The shorter length and reversible mixed-media element are positive, but the light cream color is outside the dark earth-tone palette and the overall aesthetic is clean and minimal rather than textured and embellished."

    "tier": 3,
    "rationale": "Cropped yellow wool peacoat with oversized fit and double-breasted closure. The cropped length and oversized volume are strong positives, but bright yellow is a clear conflict with the dark/warm earth-tone color palette preference. The lack of textural detail or hardware beyond standard buttons is also a gap."
