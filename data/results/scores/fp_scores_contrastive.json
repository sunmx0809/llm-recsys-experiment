    "rationale": "Olive green oversized barn coat with corduroy collar and flannel lining peeking out, providing mixed-material interest. The olive color and relaxed fit are correct, and the contrasting collar adds some textural complexity. However, the overall silhouette is a conventional workwear barn coat without the craft-forward embellishment the user requires for engagement."

    "price": "$398.00",
    "tier": 4,
    "rationale": "Long embroidered duster/kimono in cream with floral embroidery, extending well below mid-thigh. Despite the beautiful craft embroidery, the long open-front kimono/robe silhouette is an explicit rejection trigger (artisanal details in bohemian constructions get rejected), and the cream/beige colorway lacks dark contrast elements."

    "tier": 3,
    "rationale": "Cropped denim jacket with elasticized/gathered hem giving a bomber-adjacent shape in light blue wash. The silhouette is promising, but the light washed-out blue is a cool tone outside the preferred palette, and the plain denim construction lacks the embellishment or textural complexity the user demands."

    "price": "$198.00",
    "tier": 2,
    "rationale": "Vegan leather bomber in cognac/brown with a relaxed oversized fit, zip front, and ribbed hem. The bomber silhouette, warm brown color, glossy faux leather material, and price point align with multiple preferences. However, the plain unadorned construction fails the Embellishment Imperative -- this is a bomber without meaningful surface-level design interest, which the profile explicitly says was a rejection pattern even from desirable brands."

    "price": "$273.00",
    "tier": 4,
    "rationale": "Red leather hooded jacket with a fitted silhouette. The bright red color is outside the preferred earth-tone palette, the fitted/body-skimming cut conflicts with the oversized preference, and the red leather with hooded construction reads as a conventional sporty piece without craft-forward details."

    "price": "$550.00",
    "tier": 1,
    "rationale": "Cropped open-front jacket in warm cognac/rust with elaborate bold embroidery, whip-stitch detailing, and mixed-material applique work. The warm earth-tone palette (cognac, blue, cream), rich artisanal craft embellishment, cropped silhouette, and oversized relaxed fit align with nearly every stated preference. The extensive decorative surface work and mixed textile techniques make this a strong craft-forward modernist piece. The open front is a concern but the overall craft intensity may override it."

    "tier": 3,
    "rationale": "Cropped blazer in a cream/off-white textured fabric with a single-button closure. While the textured weave provides some visual interest and the cropped silhouette is correct, the blazer form is close to the tailored/corporate anti-preference, the pale cream color lacks darker contrast elements, and the fitted silhouette is not relaxed/oversized."

    "rationale": "Oversized quilted puffer-style jacket in a brown/tan houndstooth check pattern with metal hardware. The warm earth-tone color, oversized relaxed fit, quilted texture, and the houndstooth pattern provide textural and visual interest. However, it lacks the pronounced artisanal/craft embellishment the user strongly prefers, and the premium price for a conventional quilted form is a concern."

    "rationale": "Cropped plaid/check jacket in muted green-beige tones with button front. The cropped length and check pattern provide some visual interest. However, the fitted silhouette, conventional button-front construction, and overall plain styling lack the textural complexity and embellishment the user requires. The cool-toned check pattern is also not quite in the preferred warm palette."

The warm earth-tone color, cropped silhouette, zip closure, and mixed-material element of the contrasting leather collar provide moderate alignment. However, the overall construction is still relatively plain without the pronounced embellishment or craft detailing that would push it to Tier 1."
