The distressed leather finish and shearling collar provide mixed-material textural complexity. Misses Tier 1 because the embellishment is more inherent to the aviator form than a distinctive decorative element, and $698 is high for what is ultimately a fairly classic flight jacket shape."

The distressed leather finish adds textural character. Falls short of Tier 1 because the bomber lacks a distinctive decorative embellishment beyond the distressing, which is inherent to the material treatment rather than applied surface design."

The dark floral on olive reads as warm earth-tone camouflage rather than bright. Misses Tier 1 because the parka silhouette is not quite bomber-adjacent and the floral could read as boho to this user."
