## STRONG PREFERENCES (5/5 agent consensus, high confidence)

### Silhouette
- Strongly prefers **bomber jacket** and bomber-adjacent shapes: cropped, rounded body, ribbed/elasticized hem and cuffs
- All outerwear should be **cropped to hip-length** — nothing below mid-thigh
- Prefers **relaxed/oversized fit** with volume in body and sleeves — not body-skimming, tailored, or fitted

### Material
- Drawn to **faux leather / leather-look materials** for their glossy, smooth surface texture
- Interest in **textural complexity and mixed-media construction** — garments that combine two or more different materials or techniques

### Color
- Palette anchored in **dark and warm earth tones**: black, cognac/rich brown, deep olive, chocolate, camel
- Gravitates toward warm neutrals rather than cool tones, pastels, or brights

### Closure
- Preference for **zip-front closures**

## MEDIUM CONFIDENCE PREFERENCES (3-5/5 agent consensus)

### Details & Embellishment
- Appreciates **artisanal/craft detailing**: embroidery, fairisle knitting, cable-knit, whip-stitch, chevron weave
- Drawn to **statement hardware and metal accents**: grommets, ring-pull zippers, snaps
- Interest in **cape and non-standard sleeve constructions** as alternative silhouettes

### Color Specifics
- Particular affinity for **warm brown/cognac tones** (3/5 agents)

### Price
- Core shopping range: $100–$200
- Willing to pay significantly more ($700+) for a truly distinctive designer piece
- Retro/vintage sensibility in design aesthetic

## ANTI-PREFERENCES (inferred from absence in positive selections)

### Silhouettes to Avoid
- Long coats, trenches, and any outerwear below mid-thigh
- Traditional denim jackets (basic/unmodified forms)
- Heavily tailored/corporate blazers

### Materials to Avoid
- Fur, shearling, and fuzzy textures
- Performance/technical outerwear fabrics

### Aesthetics to Avoid
- Bright or pastel colors
- Puffer/quilted coats
- Minimalist/unadorned basics
- Pastel/delicate femininity

## STYLE SUMMARY
The user's aesthetic combines sporty bomber silhouettes with artisanal craft traditions — embroidery, mixed materials, decorative hardware. The overall effect is "bohemian-meets-urban-cool" or "artisanal-edge casual": warm, textured, handmade-feeling details in contemporary, relaxed jacket forms. She wants outerwear with personality and visual interest.
