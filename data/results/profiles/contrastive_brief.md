---

## STRONG PREFERENCES (high confidence)

### Silhouette
- Strongly prefers **bomber jacket** and bomber-adjacent shapes: cropped, rounded body, ribbed/elasticized hem and cuffs
- All outerwear must be **cropped to hip-length** — nothing below mid-thigh
- Prefers **relaxed/oversized fit** with volume in body and sleeves — not body-skimming, tailored, or fitted

### Texture & Construction
- Requires **textural complexity or material mixing** — every selected item had at least one element of visual/tactile interest
- Strongly drawn to **mixed-material / hybrid construction**: two or more different materials or techniques combined in a single garment (e.g., knit sleeves on a woven body, whip-stitch yarn detailing on leather)
- Plain, single-material, texturally flat jackets hold zero interest regardless of quality or price

### Color
- Palette anchored in **dark and warm earth tones**: black, cognac/rich brown, deep olive, chocolate, camel
- Will accept lighter base colors (cream, ivory) ONLY when heavily decorated with darker contrast elements
- Avoids pastels, pure white, cool tones, washed-out neutrals, and bright primary colors

## CONDITIONAL PREFERENCES (important qualifiers)

### The "Embellishment Imperative"
- The bomber silhouette is necessary but NOT sufficient — the user rejected plain, unadorned bombers even from desirable brands at higher price points
- Every selected bomber had a distinguishing decorative element: embroidery, fairisle knitting, chevron texture, metal grommets, geometric print, or whip-stitch detailing
- **Rule: recommend bombers only when they have meaningful surface-level design interest**

### Faux Leather (Conditional)
- Drawn to faux leather and leather-look materials for their glossy, smooth surface texture
- BUT rejects faux leather in conventional forms: standard moto jacket and fitted/shrunken jacket silhouettes were both skipped
- Faux leather must appear in **unconventional silhouettes** (cape, swing jacket, funnel-neck bomber) or with **added artisanal detail** (whip-stitching, interesting construction)
- Prefers smooth/glossy faux leather over matte suede

### Artisanal Details (Conditional)
- Appreciates craft-inspired embellishment: embroidery, fairisle knitting, cable-knit, whip-stitch, chevron weave
- BUT only when housed in **structured, modern silhouettes** (bomber, zip-front jacket, blazer hybrid)
- Rejects the same craft details when they appear in bohemian/peasant constructions (tie-front, open-front, quilted robe-like jackets)

### Cape/Unconventional Silhouettes (Conditional)
- Shows interest in cape and poncho shapes as a secondary silhouette
- BUT only in substantial, fashion-forward materials (coated twill, faux leather) — not in lightweight cotton or soft fabric

### Price Behavior
- Core shopping range: $100–$200
- Willingness to pay scales with **design novelty**, not brand prestige or material quality
- Will pay a premium ($700+) for a truly architecturally distinctive piece
- Will NOT pay a premium for expensive items in conventional forms (classic blazers, plain leather bombers, traditional coats), regardless of brand

## ANTI-PREFERENCES (strong evidence of rejection)

### Silhouettes to Avoid
- Long coats, trenches, and any outerwear below mid-thigh (6+ examples rejected)
- Traditional tailored/corporate blazers in single materials (4+ examples rejected)
- Classic moto jacket silhouette
- Vests and sleeveless outerwear
- Trench coat styling (belted, lapeled, button-front)

### Materials to Avoid
- Suede (both real and faux) — 3 examples at 3 different price points all rejected
- Faux fur and heavy plush textures
- Plain, unadorned single-material construction (largest category of rejections)

### Aesthetics to Avoid
- Boho/festival/tie-front closures — even when paired with embroidery or craft details the user otherwise likes
- Pastel, white, and washed-out colorways
- Corporate/minimalist styling
- Animal prints (zebra, cow print)
- Special occasion/bridal pieces

### Closure to Avoid
- Tie-front and open-front constructions
- Strong preference for zip-front; will accept buttons on hybrid/unusual pieces

## STYLE SUMMARY
The user's aesthetic combines the structure and ease of sporty bomber silhouettes with the visual richness of artisanal craft traditions — embroidery, fairisle knitting, mixed materials, decorative hardware. The overall effect is "craft-forward modernist" or "artisan-urban": warm, textured, handmade-feeling details grounded in sharp, contemporary, urban jacket forms. She wants every jacket to be a statement piece with personality, never a basic or a background layer.
